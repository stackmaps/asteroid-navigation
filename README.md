# asteroid-navigation

Intermediate project to learn about navigation algorithms using Python 3 and pygame.

In this project, you will create algorithms to navigate your spaceship through an asteroid field. To do this, you will need to learn about different pathfinding and collision detection techniques.

## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE

You should be fairly comfortable with Python, understanding topics such as control structures, loops, mathematics, and other basic programming concepts.

## The Story

Recently you have been given tickets to a Frankie Boyle comedy concert, HOWEVER, the special is to be given on the moon. And Saturn as well. You made the trip safely enough and enjoyed Frankie Boyle’s high-class comedy for 1 full hour, but the imbecillic politicians outlawed immigration from Saturn two full minutes ago. It’s really your fault for going there knowing your return trip would be compromised, but c'est la vie.  You observed a suspicious looking used rocketship that the Saturnians pulled out of a shed, and decided to steal it. Unfortunately there are a number of problems with the rocketship: it has a leaky oxygen supply, broken solar panels, and a ruined autopilot system. The technician who pulled it out said that your chances of survival were exactly 1 in 9,647,856,774,432,553. You, however, believe in your skills as a programmer, and decide to program your rocketship to arrive safely on Earth before your oxygen supplies run out. Your rocketship contains all the necessary boosters and lift-off capabilities, but the computer only has a Python interpreter for some reason best known to the folk of Saturn, with pygame installed for entertainment purposes.
